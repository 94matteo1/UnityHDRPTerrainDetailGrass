# UnityHDRPTerrainDetailGrass
A very simple detail shader (hack) for the new Terrain engine 2018.3+

Just download/copy the shader under any folder in your Assets folder. It will replace the current detail shader used by the terrain engine. No idea about performance or optimization. It just receives the detail texture and makes it paintable in hdrp :)

Billboard mode or coloring does not work as of yet. Do not even know if I can make them work :)
